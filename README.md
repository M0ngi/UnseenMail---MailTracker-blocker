# UnseenMail, An online emailTracker blocker
UnseenMail, an extension that blocks email trackers.

A simple extension that currently blocks the following list of trackers:
* [Email Tracker for Gmail](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/email-tracker-for-gmail-m/ndnaehgpjlnokgebbaldlmgkapkpjkkb?hl=en)
* [Email Tracker](chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/email-tracker/bnompdfnhdbgdaoanapncknhmckenfog/)

I will work on making a more general solution for such a thing. Also I might work more on the UI to improve it.
